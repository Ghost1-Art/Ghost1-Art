# **Mark Peter Rigden — The Gateway Ghost**
### **Building real systems, not shortcuts.**

I create verifiable digital workflows, dissolve engines, and offline-first creative systems designed for one purpose:

**To give non-tech creators the power to build real AI-driven work that is traceable, independent, and truly theirs.**

## 🛠️ **What I Build**

- **Offline-first creative systems** (no cloud dependency)  
- **Node.js + Express local environments**  
- **Canvas-based dissolve/reform engines**  
- **Verifiable file chains using SHA-256+**  
- **Transparent versioning workflows**  
- **Deployments to Vercel, WordPress, and custom servers**  
- **Beginner-friendly code bases built for learning**

Everything I publish starts on my own machine — built locally, verified, hashed, and deployed with full authorship trails.

## 💭 **What I Believe**

The new creative world rewards the makers who can:

**Build.**  
**Verify.**  
**Prove origin.**

AI is powerful — **but only if you understand the machine you’re running it on**.

My work bridges that gap for new creators: helping them learn the real fundamentals before they drown in hype.

No gurus.  
No hacks.  
No fake “laptop lifestyle.”  
Just real skills and traceable work.

## ⚠️ **Fundamental Fact (Read This Before Anything Else)**

The funny part is this:

**I built everything you see here for free — until the moment I chose to push it live.**

No auto-agents.  
No AI writing my systems.  
No shortcuts pretending to be “productivity.”

Everything was built **locally**, on my own device:

- verified  
- hashed  
- version-controlled  
- portable  
- and owned by me  

Because **local is safety first.**  
Local is authorship.  
Local means your work stays *yours* — not swallowed into an anonymous dataset.

People say “AI will do everything.”  
Here’s the truth:

**AI doesn’t move unless *you* do.  
Your machine doesn’t build anything unless *you* understand it.**

That’s the foundation of The Gateway Ghost.

## ✨ **Highlight: KIFF — Digital Mother Dissolve**

A fully editable, pixel-driven dissolve/reform engine powering The Gateway Ghost homepage.

Includes:

- real-time particle decay + reform  
- image-to-particle conversion  
- text-based dissolves  
- variable timing + speed curves  
- randomisation patterns  
- clean, dependency-free canvas rendering

## 🧾 **Integrity & Authorship**

I maintain daily verification logs privately on removable media:

- SHA-256 proof chains  
- version history  
- authorship trails  
- cold storage backups  

Public repositories contain **sanitized code only** — never private proofs.
